# Graph and Queue Implementation in C++

## Overview
This project implements a Graph and an accompanying Queue data structure in C++. The graph supports up to 20 vertices, each of which can have up to 5 neighbors. A breadth-first search (BFS) traversal is implemented using the queue.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficiently manages memory for the queue using a linked list.
- **Fixed-Size Graph**: Supports up to 20 vertices, each with up to 5 neighbors.
- **BFS Traversal**: Implements breadth-first search for graph exploration.
- **Vertex and Edge Management**: Add, remove, and connect vertices with weighted edges.

## How It Works

### Graph Representation
- The graph is represented using an array of pointers to `GraphNode` objects (`vertexList[20]`).
- Each `GraphNode` can have up to 5 neighbors and corresponding edge weights.

### Queue
- A linked list-based queue is used for BFS traversal.
- Enqueues and dequeues vertices dynamically as the traversal progresses.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Starts from a designated `startPoint`.
- Traverses the graph level by level, using the queue to manage exploration.
- Marks visited vertices to avoid revisiting.
